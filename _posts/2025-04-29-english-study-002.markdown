# Software Testing Standup Meeting: Sentence Database 2

This document provides a collection of useful phrases and sentence patterns for participants in a software testing daily standup meeting. It aims to cover common scenarios and help testers communicate their progress, plans, and impediments effectively.

*Cultural Tip:* Standups are meant to be quick synchronization meetings, not detailed problem-solving sessions. Keep your updates concise and focused. If a longer discussion is needed, suggest taking it offline with the relevant people. Use clear and unambiguous language, especially when reporting blockers. Be mindful of time and stick to the key points: what you did, what you plan to do, and any blockers.

## Category 1: Reporting Progress (What I did yesterday)

Focuses on summarizing completed tasks and findings from the previous workday.

### 1.1 Completed Test Case Execution

- **Pattern:** Yesterday, I finished executing the test cases for `[Feature/Module]`.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** Yesterday, I finished executing the test cases for the shopping cart module. Found a few issues with quantity updates that need to be addressed.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** Yesterday, I completed the execution of test procedures documented for the authentication service (TC-101 through TC-118). I identified 3 defects of medium severity which have been formally logged in the defect tracking system with appropriate evidence.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** Yesterday, I wrapped up running the test suite for the payment processing workflow. The credit card path passed successfully, but I encountered a significant issue with the PayPal integration – the confirmation page intermittently displays an error message despite the transaction being successfully processed on the backend. This could lead to user confusion and potential duplicate payment attempts. I've attached detailed logs and network traces to JIRA-456 and initiated a discussion with the payment gateway team.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Completed notification system tests yesterday. 14/15 passed. Bug filed for failed push notification test (JIRA-789).

- **Pattern:** I wrapped up testing `[Specific Functionality]` yesterday.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** I wrapped up testing the password reset flow yesterday. Everything looks good there.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** The testing activities concerning the user profile update functionality were concluded yesterday. All test cases passed without significant deviations.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** I wrapped up testing the new CSV data import feature yesterday. It handles standard files well, but I noticed it struggles with files containing special characters or very large datasets (over 100MB). The parsing logic seems to time out. I've detailed these limitations and edge cases in TEST-521 for development review.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Finished password reset tests. Pass.

- **Pattern:** My main focus yesterday was on executing tests related to `[Area]`.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** My main focus yesterday was on executing tests related to the API endpoints for user management. Found a couple of minor documentation mismatches.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** My primary activity yesterday involved the execution of test scripts pertaining to the reporting dashboard's data aggregation features.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** My main focus yesterday was on executing the regression test suite related to the core rendering engine, specifically after the refactoring changes merged last Friday. I wanted to ensure no performance degradation or visual glitches were introduced. So far, performance metrics look stable, but I found one minor layout issue on mobile viewports (logged as BUG-910).
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Focused on API user management tests. Minor docs issues found.

### 1.2 Automated Test Runs

- **Pattern:** The automated test suite for `[Component/Pipeline]` ran yesterday/overnight.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** The automated test suite for the UI ran overnight. Looks like a few tests failed, need to investigate.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** The scheduled execution of the automated regression suite for the backend services completed yesterday evening. Results analysis is pending.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** The automated test suite for the CI/CD build pipeline (covering unit, integration, and smoke tests) ran after the last deployment yesterday. The overall result is green, but I noticed a spike in execution time for the integration tests. I'll dig into the logs today to see if it's a genuine performance dip or just a test environment fluctuation.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** UI automation ran overnight. Some failures require investigation.

- **Pattern:** I analyzed the results from the `[Test Type]` automated run.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** I analyzed the results from the nightly regression automated run. Found one real bug and two flaky tests.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** Yesterday, I completed the analysis of the output from the automated performance test execution conducted on the staging environment.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** I analyzed the results from the automated API contract test run against the latest build of the Orders microservice. Most tests passed, confirming schema adherence, but one endpoint (`/orders/{id}/status`) returned an unexpected HTTP 500 error under specific load conditions. I suspect a race condition and have created ticket API-303 with details for the development team.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Analyzed nightly run results: 1 bug, 2 flaky tests identified.

- **Pattern:** Fixed `[Number]` flaky tests in the `[Test Suite Name]` suite.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** Fixed 3 flaky tests in the UI regression suite yesterday. They were related to timing issues.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** Yesterday, efforts were focused on stabilizing the 'Checkout End-to-End' automated test suite, resulting in the resolution of 3 non-deterministic test cases.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** I spent time yesterday investigating and fixing 3 flaky tests that have been polluting our 'Mobile App Login' automation suite results recently. One was due to an inconsistent animation delay, another was a locator that became ambiguous after the UI update, and the third had a hardcoded wait time that wasn't always sufficient. They should be more reliable now.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Fixed 3 flaky tests in UI regression suite.

### 1.3 Bug Verification

- **Pattern:** I verified the fix for bug `[Bug ID/Number]`.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** I verified the fix for bug JIRA-123 yesterday. It's working correctly now.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** Verification testing was performed on defect #4567, related to the data export error. The resolution implemented by the development team has been confirmed as effective.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** I verified the fix for bug BUG-888, the one causing the user profile picture upload to fail for certain image formats. The developer added better validation and handling for unsupported types. I tested with JPG, PNG, GIF, and also tried uploading a PDF and an SVG – the valid types worked, and the invalid ones now show a clear error message as expected. Closing the ticket.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Verified fix for JIRA-123. Issue resolved.

- **Pattern:** Checked the resolution for `[Brief Description of Bug]`.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** Checked the resolution for the login button alignment issue on Firefox. Looks fixed.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** Yesterday, I reviewed the implemented solution for the reported discrepancy in the calculation logic of the summary report (Ticket #789).
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** Checked the resolution for the issue where filtering the transaction list by date range wasn't including the end date correctly. The fix involved adjusting the query logic. I tested various date ranges, including single days and ranges spanning across months/years, and it now correctly includes transactions from both the start and end dates specified.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Reviewed fix for report calculation bug (#789). Confirmed correct.

- **Pattern:** Retested `[Number]` bugs that were marked as resolved.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** Retested 5 bugs that were marked as resolved yesterday. 4 are fixed, but one needs to be reopened.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** Performed regression testing on 5 defect resolutions provided by the development team yesterday. Four were successfully validated; one requires further attention (BUG-101).
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** I went through the list of bugs assigned to me for verification and retested 5 of them yesterday. JIRA-555 (incorrect tax calculation), JIRA-560 (typo on confirmation page), JIRA-561 (slow loading user list), and JIRA-570 (broken link in footer) are all fixed and working as expected. However, JIRA-565 (session timeout issue) is still reproducible under the original conditions, so I've reopened it with comments and new logs.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Retested 5 resolved bugs. 4 verified, 1 reopened (BUG-101).

### 1.4 Exploratory Testing

- **Pattern:** Did some exploratory testing around `[Feature/Area]`.

  - **Example 2 (Formal):** Conducted exploratory testing sessions yesterday focusing on the recently implemented 'Advanced Search' functionality.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** Yesterday, I dedicated a couple of hours to exploratory testing around the file upload component, specifically trying different file types, sizes, naming conventions (including special characters), and network interruption scenarios. While the basic functionality works, I found that uploading a file with a very long name causes a UI layout issue, and interrupting the upload doesn't always provide clear feedback to the user. I've documented these findings in my test notes and will raise defects today if they aren't already known issues.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Exploratory testing on user permissions. Findings documented.

- **Pattern:** Focused my exploratory efforts on `[Specific Workflow/Scenario]`.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** Focused my exploratory efforts on the checkout process with invalid coupon codes. Found an edge case.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** My exploratory testing activities yesterday were concentrated on the user registration workflow, particularly concerning edge cases related to input validation.

I explored scenarios like inviting existing users, inviting users with email addresses already associated with deactivated accounts, sending multiple invites to the same email, and checking how access permissions are applied upon acceptance. I discovered that inviting an already existing team member doesn't provide clear feedback, it just silently fails. Logged as UIX-204.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Explored checkout with invalid coupons. Found an edge case.

- **Pattern:** Uncovered `[Number/Type of Issues]` during exploratory testing of `[Area]`.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** Uncovered a couple of minor usability issues during exploratory testing of the settings page.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** During the exploratory testing phase for the reporting module, one critical defect and two minor usability concerns were identified.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** While doing exploratory testing on the mobile app's offline mode yesterday, I uncovered a significant issue where data synced just before going offline sometimes doesn't appear until the app is restarted after regaining connectivity. It seems like a caching or sync logic problem. I also found a minor UI glitch on the offline status indicator. I'll log the critical issue (DATA-SYNC-11) as high priority.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Found 1 critical, 2 minor issues exploring reporting module.

### 1.5 Test Documentation / Planning

- **Pattern:** Spent time yesterday writing/updating test cases for `[Feature/Story]`.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** Spent time yesterday writing test cases for the new notification preferences feature.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** Yesterday's activities included the development and refinement of test case documentation for user story US-789, 'Implement Two-Factor Authentication'.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** I dedicated yesterday afternoon to updating the existing test cases for the user profile section to incorporate the new fields added in the last sprint (pronouns and preferred contact method). This involved adding new steps, expected results, and ensuring appropriate test data coverage for these fields across different user types. I also added test cases for editing and clearing these new fields.
