# Software Testing Standup Meeting: Sentence Database

This document provides a collection of useful phrases and sentence patterns for participants in a software testing daily standup meeting. It aims to cover common scenarios and help testers communicate their progress, plans, and impediments effectively.

*Cultural Tip:* Standups are meant to be quick synchronization meetings, not detailed problem-solving sessions. Keep your updates concise and focused. If a longer discussion is needed, suggest taking it offline with the relevant people. Use clear and unambiguous language, especially when reporting blockers. Avoid overly technical jargon unless the entire team understands it. Transparency about blockers is crucial for team progress.

## Category 1: Reporting Progress (What I did yesterday)

Focuses on summarizing completed tasks, findings, and activities from the previous workday.

### 1.1 Completed Test Case Execution

- **Pattern 1:** Yesterday, I finished executing the test cases for `[Feature/Module/Ticket ID]`.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** Yesterday, I finished executing the test cases for the user profile update feature. Found a couple of minor UI bugs.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** Execution of the test suite pertaining to the user profile modification functionality (Ref: JIRA-123) was completed yesterday. All high-priority test cases passed.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** Yesterday, I wrapped up the test execution for the user profile changes. This involved checking image uploads, password updates, and contact info changes across Chrome and Firefox. The image upload works, but password updates fail if the password contains special characters, which I've documented in BUG-456. Contact info updates are fine.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Completed profile update tests (JIRA-123) yesterday. 2 minor UI bugs found.

- **Pattern 2:** Completed testing on the `[Area/Functionality]` yesterday.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** Completed testing on the checkout flow yesterday. Payment processing looks good.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** Test activities for the primary checkout sequence were concluded yesterday. Verification of payment gateway integration was successful.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** Yesterday, I completed the testing effort focused on the checkout process. I simulated purchases using credit cards, PayPal, and gift cards. While credit cards and PayPal worked seamlessly, the system fails to apply gift card discounts correctly under certain conditions, specifically when combined with a promotional code. Details are in BUG-457.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Checkout flow testing done. Payment integration OK. Gift card discount bug filed (BUG-457).

- **Pattern 3:** Wrapped up the `[Type of Testing]` for `[Feature/Module]`.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** Wrapped up the regression testing for the login module after the security patch. Everything seems okay.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** Concluded the regression testing cycle for the authentication module subsequent to the deployment of security patch v1.2. No regressions were identified.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** I finished the regression tests for the login system yesterday. This was crucial after the latest security update. I checked standard logins, password resets, 'remember me' functionality, and SSO integration. All core functions are working as expected, confirming the patch didn't break existing behavior.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Login regression testing complete post-patch. No issues found.

### 1.2 Investigated a Bug/Issue

- **Pattern 1:** Yesterday, I investigated `[Bug ID/Issue Description]`.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** Yesterday, I investigated the issue where the dashboard widgets weren't loading for some users.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** The investigation into BUG-450, concerning intermittent loading failures of dashboard widgets, was conducted yesterday.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** Yesterday, I spent time investigating BUG-450, the dashboard widget loading problem. I found it seems to happen primarily on Safari and only when the user has more than 10 custom widgets configured. I suspect it might be a frontend timeout issue when fetching data for many widgets simultaneously. I've added my findings and network logs to the ticket.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Investigated BUG-450 (dashboard widgets). Root cause likely Safari + many widgets. Details in ticket.

- **Pattern 2:** Looked into the problem with `[Feature/Area]` reported by `[Person/Team]`.

  - **Example 2 (Formal):** Investigated the file upload anomaly reported by the Customer Support department. A temporary mitigation strategy has been identified.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** Yesterday, I looked into the file upload errors that support flagged. It seems files over 50MB are timing out during the virus scan step. While the dev team works on optimizing the scanner, I found that uploading in chunks using the API bypasses the issue. I've shared this workaround with support.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Investigated support-reported upload issue. Cause: large file scan timeout. Workaround identified.

- **Pattern 3:** Spent time debugging the `[Error/Failure]` in `[Environment/Module]`.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** Spent time debugging the database connection error in the staging environment.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** Allocated time yesterday to debug the database connectivity failure observed within the staging environment's reporting service.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** I spent most of yesterday debugging that database connection error popping up in the staging reporting service. Traced it back to a misconfigured connection pool setting introduced during the last deployment. It wasn't releasing connections properly, leading to exhaustion. I've documented the required config change in JIRA-125.

### 5.1 Reporting Potential Issues (Not Yet Bugs)

- **Pattern 1:** I noticed some strange behavior with `[Feature/Area]`. Might be worth looking into.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** I noticed some strange behavior with the search auto-complete. Sometimes it flashes results then they disappear. Might be worth looking into.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** Observed anomalous behavior pertaining to the search auto-complete functionality, characterized by transient result displays. Further investigation may be warranted.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** While testing search yesterday, I saw something odd with the auto-complete suggestions. Occasionally, the list of suggestions would appear briefly and then immediately vanish. It's intermittent and I can't reproduce it reliably yet, but it feels like a potential race condition or UI glitch. Haven't logged it yet, but wanted to flag it.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Observation: Search auto-complete sometimes flashes/disappears. Intermittent. Potential issue.

  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** While testing the advanced settings yesterday, I noticed some options have quite technical names without much explanation. For users who aren't experts, it might be confusing. Just a thought: maybe we could add little help icons with tooltips explaining what each setting does? Logged as a suggestion JIRA-SUG-10.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Suggestion: Add tooltips to advanced settings options for clarity (JIRA-SUG-10).

- **Pattern 2:** It might be helpful for testing if `[Change in Process/Tool]` was implemented.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** It might be helpful for testing if we had a standardized set of test users with different roles available in the QA environment.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** Consideration could be given to establishing a standardized suite of predefined test user accounts encompassing various roles within the QA environment, which would likely benefit testing efficiency.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** I find myself often manually creating or modifying users to get specific roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer) for testing permissions. It takes time and sometimes leads to inconsistencies. Would it be possible for DevOps to pre-populate the QA env with a standard set of test users representing each role? Might streamline things.
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Suggestion: Standardize test users (roles) in QA env to improve efficiency.

- **Pattern 3:** Found a useful `[Tool/Technique]` that could help us with `[Testing Activity]`.
  - **Example 1 (Normal):** Found a useful browser extension for accessibility testing that automatically flags common issues like contrast errors. Could help us speed up manual checks.
  - **Example 2 (Formal):** Identified a potentially beneficial browser extension designed for accessibility analysis, capable of automatically detecting common violations (e.g., contrast ratios), which may expedite manual verification processes.
  - **Example 3 (Explanatory):** I came across a Chrome extension called 'axe DevTools' which does a great job of automatically scanning a page for WCAG accessibility issues. It found a few things on our site quickly. Maybe the team could look into using it as a first-pass check during development or testing?
  - **Example 4 (Concise):** Suggestion: Explore 'axe DevTools' browser extension for faster accessibility checks.
